## Description

The objective of this project was to take the starter codease of a fully functioning tech quiz application and add Cypress for both component and end-to-end (e2e) tests to ensure that everything is running as intended.The application allows users to take a quiz of ten random questions and view their final score. It was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

## Installation

Node.js and MongoDB is required to run this code. Node.js can be installed by visting [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). MongoDB can be installed by visiting [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Usage

This project was used to get a better understanding of how to use Cypress to test functionalities of an application via component and e2e testing.

## Tests

In your git bash where this repo is located, run npm install which runs the package.json file to install the necessary modules. Then run npm run build to build the code. Next, run npm run seed to automatically seed some questions into the database. After that, run npm run start:dev to host the application locally on your device. Finally, open another git bash in the same working directory and run npm run test which will start Cypress and perform both the component and e2e tests. Below, shows the sequence of what to run in your git bash and makes it easier for you to copy and paste each line.

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run seed
npm run start:dev
```

```
npm run test
```
